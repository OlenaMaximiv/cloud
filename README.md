# Cloud Learnings Repo

Or: A place to put all our stuff

# Description

This repository was originally created by the authors as a place to collaborate on writing and development projects.  It contains blogs drafts that are intended to be publicly published as well as useful code that the authors are either working on or have finished.    

# How to Contribute

The intention of the repo is for the use of the authors, but if you wish to contribute, cut a branch from main and PR to all authors.  Collaboration is a wonderful thing.
